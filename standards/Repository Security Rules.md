# Repository Security Rules

## Objective
To establish standard security requirements for all code repositories that are either original to or hard project forks by Hoyt Harness, including any development organizations he manages, e.g. Positronikal. These requirements apply to both local and online repositories, e.g. GitHub. The result should be that such repositories exist as secure development environments with comprehensive security automation, testing, and governance. This policy adapts security best practices for different project types while maintaining consistency across repositories.

See [./COMMON.md](./COMMON.md) for common exceptions and additional requirements.

This document is broken down into the following sections:

* [Implementation Framework](./security/implementation-framework.md)
* [Testing Framework](./security/testing-framework.md)
* [Automation and Tooling](./security/automation-and-tooling.md)
* [Documentation and Compliance](./security/documentation-and-compliance.md)
* [Checklists](./security/checklists.md)
* [Customization](./security/customization.md)
* [Metrics](./security/metrics.md)

This framework transforms any repository into a secure development environment suitable for professional and enterprise use cases while maintaining developer productivity and code quality.
