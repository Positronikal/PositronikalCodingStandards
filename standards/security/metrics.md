# Metrics & KPIs

Track these security metrics across all repositories:
- **MTTR for Security Issues**: Target < 48 hours for critical, < 7 days for high
- **Dependency Update Frequency**: Weekly automated, monthly manual review
- **Security Test Coverage**: Maintain > 80% coverage including security tests
- **Vulnerability Backlog**: Zero tolerance for critical/high severity issues
- **Security Scan Frequency**: Every commit + weekly scheduled comprehensive scans

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1)
1. SECURITY.md policy creation
2. Dependabot security scanning activation
3. Basic CI/CD security integration
4. Critical vulnerability assessment

### Medium Priority (Week 2-3)
1. CodeQL implementation
2. Comprehensive security test suite
3. Security automation scripts
4. Documentation updates

### Low Priority (Month 1)
1. Advanced threat modeling
2. Compliance documentation
3. Security metrics dashboard
4. Team training materials
