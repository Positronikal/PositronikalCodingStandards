## Git and GitHub Requirements

**Repository Access:**
- GitHub is the sole provider for public collaboration
- Git is the sole version control system for this project
- Two-factor authentication is required for all contributors
- GPG-signed commits are strongly preferred for security-related changes

**Pull Request Process:**
- Include clear description of changes and rationale
- Reference any related issues or discussions
- Ensure all template files are updated consistently
- Add yourself to AUTHORS.md if making significant contributions

## Legal Requirements

### Contributor License
For substantial contributions (beyond minor corrections), a signed contributor license agreement may be required. This helps protect both contributors and users of the framework.

### Intellectual Property

- Do not include proprietary or confidential information

### Professional Standards
Contributors with relevant professional certifications (CISSP, CEH, GCFA, etc.) are encouraged to note their credentials when contributing domain-specific guidance.

## Review Process

### Technical Review
- All changes undergo technical review by project maintainers
- Security-related changes may require additional expert review
- Forensic tool standards changes require legal compliance review
- Large changes may need community discussion before implementation

### Testing and Validation
- Test proposed changes against real projects when possible
- Validate tool configurations and recommendations
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility where applicable
- Document any limitations or environment-specific requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- Changes must align with the Unix Philosophy foundation
- Must maintain modularity and scalability of the framework
- Should enhance usability without sacrificing security or compliance
- Must include adequate documentation and examples

## Communication

### Preferred Channels
- GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- GitHub Discussions for general questions and community input
- Pull Request comments for specific implementation details
- Email (hoyt.harness@gmail.com) for security-sensitive matters

### Community Guidelines
- Be respectful and professional in all interactions
- Focus on technical merit and practical value
- Acknowledge different use cases and requirements
- Share knowledge and learn from others' experiences

## Recognition

Contributors who make significant improvements to the framework will be:
- Listed in AUTHORS.md with appropriate attribution
- Acknowledged in release notes for major contributions
- Invited to provide input on future framework direction
- Credited in any derived works or publications (where appropriate)

## Getting Started

1. **Review the current framework** thoroughly
2. **Identify areas for improvement** based on your experience
3. **Discuss major changes** in GitHub Issues before implementing
4. **Start with small, focused contributions** to get familiar with the process
