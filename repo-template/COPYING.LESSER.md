# GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3

This project uses the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.

## Key Features
The LGPL v3 is designed for libraries and allows:
- Linking with proprietary software (unlike full GPL)
- Modifications to the LGPL code must remain under LGPL
- Dynamic linking does not require the larger work to be GPL'd
- Static linking or code incorporation requires GPL compatibility

## Using LGPL v3 Libraries
When using LGPL v3 licensed libraries:
- You can link to them from proprietary software
- Modifications to the LGPL library itself must be shared under LGPL
- Provide users with the ability to re-link with modified versions
- Include license notices and provide LGPL license text

## When to Use LGPL
Consider LGPL v3 for:
- Libraries intended for use in both free and proprietary software
- Code that benefits from wider adoption
- Projects where full GPL would limit useful integration
