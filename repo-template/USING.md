**Note to Claude**
This needs to be fleshed out with instructions and/or guidelines for how to use the code within this repository for both developers and users. It should describe the project prerequisites, setup, dependencies, how to run specific scripts, testing, DXT compilation, installation, and usage - all with a generic client that supports MCP. Installation should cover both `uvx` (preferred manual method) and DXT. It should contain basic desciptions of all 21 tools that are included. It should point to the `docs/` directory for complete Doxygen documentation. If you find that you need to add more information than a reasonably-sized USING file should have, we can always take advantage of the repo's wiki on GitHub to get as detailed and comprehensive as you'd like. Delete this note when you've completed this.
