## Repository Map
The following are subdirectories and root files you may find in this repository. Not all of these are present or requirefd in every repository.

### Repository Subdirectories
**[bin/](./bin 'bin/')**
- Contains executables or third-party binaries
- For web projects: may contain compiled/processed assets from `src/raw/`
- Exclude with [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore '.gitignore') if not licensed for distribution

**[docs/](./docs 'docs/')**
- Contains development documentation to understand, maintain, and collaborate on this project.

**[etc/](./etc 'etc/')**
- Serves as a scratch catch-all for developers.

**[rel/](./rel 'rel/')**
- Contains releases that may be alpha, beta, or stable.

**[src/](./src 'src/')**
- Contains source files. Structure depends on project type:
  - **Applications/Tools**: Place source code directly in `src/` (e.g., `src/main.c`, `src/utils/`)
  - **Web Projects**: Use `src/` for server-side code and `src/raw/` for client-side assets
  - **Mixed Projects**: Use both approaches as needed

**[src/raw/](./src/raw 'src/raw/')** *(web projects only)*
- Contains raw web assets that may need processing or compilation:
  - `aud/` - Audio files
  - `css/` - Stylesheets (SCSS, LESS, or raw CSS)
  - `img/` - Images and graphics
  - `js/` - Client-side JavaScript
  - `vid/` - Video files
- Omit this directory for non-web projects

**[test/](.test 'test/')**
- Contains testing materials.
